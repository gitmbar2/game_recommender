We should build a recommender system, but if the user is in cold start phase, we can instead recommend them the most popular items, or weight popularity with a weak recommendation.  


Adjust for bias?  Games that are always highly rated; people who always rate high/low.

Consider users and games with less than n ratings from model or games/users with many many ratings and how they impact the model training.  

We are considering time playing a rating metric, but it could also be considered implicit.

Normalize for games that people play longer on average?

Graph improvements with more data.

Recommend something to deal with cold start.

Compare to recommending most popular games
